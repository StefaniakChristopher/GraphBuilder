# GraphBuilder

To run GraphBuilder, you need to install the following:

  Node.js
  JDK
  
Once these are installed, create a new folder in Visual Studio and open it

Once there, open a PowerShell Terminal and run this command: git clone https://github.com/StefaniakChristopher/GraphBuilder.git
This should clone the project onto your machine

To launch the web app, navigate to the "graph-builder" folder. This folder contains the Springboot backend.

Run this command: ./mvnw spring-boot:run

Next, navigate to the "graph-builder-frontend" (careful, there are two of these folder, make sure you are in the inner one)

Run this command: npm install

Then run this command: npm start
